### Proposal review process:

* If the project is OK the Manager asks the director for authorization.
* The Director checks the resources available, if the project fits in their general strategy, agrees on the timeframes and gives the final OK.&#x20;
* If the Director considers the project is OK, but they don't have enough resources in the current department, can offer the project to other Directors or ask for more resources to the Organization.
