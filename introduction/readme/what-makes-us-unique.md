We make the most of all our resources, and invest all of them to create more value. Sharing our knowledge, values and tools with the world. As our structure grows in an organic way, the&#x20;

INKUA is a combination of open organization and open source development models called "Open Organic Organization". It's open, meaning anyone can join and participate. Members should be able to have a full time job or study at the same time they participate in InkuA.&#x20;

Organic, meaning it grows like a plant, with "redundant" departments and positions sharing resources and tasks to allow for growth and adaptation. This means that we can have more than one department or director working on the same tasks, but with their own teams and strategies. This creates a highly creative and fast moving environment.

Just as leaves work together to photosynthesize and provide energy for the entire plant, the branches of INKUA work together to support each other, sharing resources and tasks to create a sustainable and efficient system. And just as a forest evolves and adapts to its surroundings, INKUA also evolves and adapts to the changing needs of its participants, allowing for a dynamic and flexible organization.

In this way, INKUA is not just a single entity, but a diverse and thriving ecosystem that allows for multiple perspectives and contributions, promoting growth and collaboration at every level.
