# 💖 Values

We value Cooperation, Equal Opportunities and Transparency more than anything.

### **👥 Equal Opportunities**

Providing equal opportunities for everyone by levelling the playing field is part of our mission. Real Inclusion means that everyone should have the chance to learn and practice the position they want to achieve, meaning it should be as accessible as possible, that means free, part-time and with no barriers of entry.&#x20;

### **🤝 Cooperation**

We value people as humans, we listen, we value great teams and friendship above results or big projects. Everyone has a role, a space and value.&#x20;

### **🔍 Transparency**

As a non-profit we want that our ideas, members and value to spread all over the world. So everything we do is open, free and created to share with the world!&#x20;
