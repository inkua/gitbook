# Core Values

### **🤸‍♂️ **<mark style="background-color:green;">**Equal Opportunities**</mark>

Empowering all through equal opportunities by levelling the playing field is part of our mission. Real inclusion means that everyone has the chance to learn and pursue their desired path and position. At InkuA we are commited to making these opportunities as accessible as possible: free, part-time and with no barriers of entry. Everyone has a role, a space and value.&#x20;

### **✨ **<mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Transparency**</mark>

As a non-profit we love to see our ideas, members and value to spread and spark all over the world. So everything we do is open, free and created to be shared with everyone!&#x20;

### 💖<mark style="background-color:purple;">Empathy</mark>

We’re proud of the community we’ve assembled to date; a collective of people that demonstrate respect and empathy, because they know how vulnerable makers are when introducing their project to the world.&#x20;

### 💯 <mark style="background-color:red;">Be Bold</mark>

Every day, ambitious people launch their project or department within InkuA. We encourage experimentation and bold ideas, both in the community and our own team.
