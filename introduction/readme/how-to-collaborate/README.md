# ðŸ›  How to Collaborate

We break barriers.

Real inclusion is only achieved when there are virtually zero barriers of entry for to have a fulfilling life. That's why:

ðŸ§• **We don't care about your gender, experience or age:** You are the centre of our mission, we invest our resources to create the best space for you.&#x20;

**ðŸ•’ You keep your time and resources:** We don't charge you, and we accommodate your schedule. We adapt to your priorities and the life you want, not the other way around.

ðŸ‘¥ **Work as a team:** We find like-minded people to create a great team and to collaborate on projects.&#x20;

If you share our values and our passion, we want to create a positive relationship with you.&#x20;
