# Inactive Departments

Here you can find Departments that are no longer active and department proposals. A department is considered Inactive if it lost all its members, or if it was decided to be scrapped.&#x20;

They are stored here for reference and record. The departments can be re-activated if members decide to do so.&#x20;
